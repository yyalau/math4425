# MATH4425 Introductory Time Series Final Project

## Introduction
In this project, we examined two time series datasets with statistical time series models, which include:

1)	The Historical Adjusted Close Price for CSOP Hang Seng Index Daily (-2x) Inverse
2)	Monthly Average of Global Solar Radiation, measured at Kingâ€™s Park

<!-- We examined the two Time Series Data using ARIMA-GARCH model and Seasonal ARIMA model respectively. -->
